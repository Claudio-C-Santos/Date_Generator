# Date_Generator

## The Mission

The idea of this app came from the necessity of creating a reward system for working out. The idea is that if the Bubus go to the gym 3/4 in a certain week then they are allowed to go out for dinner during the following week.

The app will help with coming up with ideas where to go out for a meal and will answer the following questions:

    - Which meal?
    - Which cuisine?
    - Does the restaurant have to be new or can it be repeated?
